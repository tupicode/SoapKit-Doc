### Your First Binding in 5 Minutes

**Goal:** Create a health bar that automatically updates when player health changes.

**Step 1: Create the SOAP Asset**
```csharp
Right-click in Project → Create > SoapKit > Variables > Int Variable
Name: "PlayerHealth"
Set Value: 100
```

**Step 2: Create the UI**
```csharp
Right-click in Hierarchy → UI > Slider
Set Min Value: 0, Max Value: 100
```

**Step 3: Add SOAPBind Component**
```csharp
Select any GameObject (Slider or create empty "BindingHub")
Add Component → Search "SOAP Bind"
```

**Step 4: Create the Binding**
```csharp
In SOAPBind Inspector:
1. Click "➕ Add Binding"
2. Drag PlayerHealth to "Source Asset"
3. Drag Slider GameObject to "Target"
4. Set Property to "value"
5. Set Mode to "OneWay"
```

**Step 5: Test It**
```csharp
Enter Play Mode
Select PlayerHealth asset
Change Value in Inspector
→ Watch Slider update automatically! ✨
```

**🎉 Congratulations!** You just created your first SOAP binding without writing any code!

## Understanding the Basics

### What are Bindings?

Bindings are **connections** between SOAP assets (Variables/Events) and Unity components that automatically synchronize data:

```csharp
// Instead of writing this code:
void Update() {
    healthSlider.value = playerHealth.Value;
    nameText.text = playerName.Value;
    // ... dozens of similar lines
}

// You create visual bindings:
PlayerHealth → HealthSlider.value (automatic)
PlayerName → NameText.text (automatic) 
```

### The SOAPBind Component

The **SOAPBind** component is the heart of the system. Add it to GameObjects to manage their bindings:

```csharp
SOAPBind Features:
├── 📋 Multiple Bindings - Manage many connections in one component
├── ⚡ Auto-Updates - Handles all synchronization automatically  
├── 🎯 Smart Detection - Finds components and properties for you
├── 📊 Performance Monitoring - Tracks performance in real-time
├── 🔧 Hot Reload - Edit bindings during Play Mode
└── 🐞 Visual Debugging - See connections in Scene view
```

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
  <img src="/img/soap-bind-component.png" alt="SOAP Bind Component Inspector" style={{width: '400px'}} />
</div>

### Understanding the Inspector

When you select a GameObject with SOAPBind, the Inspector shows:

```csharp
SOAPBind Component Inspector:

🔗 Binding List (initially empty)
   ├── [No bindings created yet]
   
🔧 Controls
   ├── ➕ Add Binding        // Create new binding
   ├── 📊 Performance Info   // Show performance stats  
   ├── 🐞 Debug Mode         // Enable debugging
   └── ⚙️ Auto Optimize      // Enable performance optimization
```

## How to Organize Your Bindings

You can organize your bindings in different ways depending on your project needs:

### Strategy 1: Centralized Hub (Recommended for Beginners)
```csharp
GameObject: "UI_BindingHub"
└── SOAPBind (manages ALL UI bindings)

Advantages:
✅ All bindings in one place
✅ Easy to find and manage
✅ Great for learning
✅ Simple performance monitoring
```

### Strategy 2: Component-Level
```csharp
GameObject: "HealthBar" 
├── Slider
└── SOAPBind (manages only health bar bindings)

GameObject: "ScoreText"
├── Text  
└── SOAPBind (manages only score text bindings)

Advantages:
✅ Bindings stay with components
✅ Better for prefabs
✅ Modular organization
```

### Strategy 3: System-Specific Hubs
```csharp
GameObject: "Audio_BindingHub"
└── Manages all audio-related bindings

GameObject: "Animation_BindingHub"  
└── Manages all animation-related bindings

GameObject: "UI_BindingHub"
└── Manages all UI-related bindings

Advantages:
✅ Organized by system responsibility
✅ Clear separation of concerns
✅ Ideal for large projects
```

## Binding Modes Explained

Now that you understand the basics, let's explore the different types of connections you can create:

### 1. **OneWay** (Unidirectional) - Most Common
**What it does:** Connects a SOAP Variable to a Unity property. When the variable changes, the property is automatically updated.

**Direction:** SOAP Variable → Unity Property

**Use cases:**
```csharp
// Health System - Health bar that shows player life
IntVariable playerHealth → Slider healthBar.value
// Player loses health → Slider updates automatically

// UI System - Player name in interface
StringVariable playerName → Text nameLabel.text
// Name changes in code → UI updates instantly

// Audio System - Dynamic volume based on distance
FloatVariable distanceVolume → AudioSource.volume
// Player moves away → Sound gets quieter automatically

// Visual System - UI color based on team
ColorVariable teamColor → Image backgroundImage.color
// Player changes team → Interface changes color
```

**When to use:** When you want to **display** game information in UI or other components, but don't need the user to directly modify the values.

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
  <img src="/img/oneway-binding.png" alt="OneWay Binding Example" style={{width: '500px'}} />
</div>

---

### 2. **TwoWay** (Bidirectional) - For User Input
**What it does:** Synchronization in both directions. The variable and property stay synchronized at all times.

**Direction:** SOAP Variable ↔ Unity Property

**Use cases:**
```csharp
// Game Settings - Volume slider
FloatVariable masterVolume ↔ Slider volumeSlider.value
// Player moves slider → Variable updates → Audio changes
// Code changes volume → Slider moves automatically

// Input System - Player name input field
StringVariable playerName ↔ InputField nameInput.text
// Player types → Variable updates
// System changes name → Input field updates

// Debug Settings - Debug toggle
BoolVariable showDebugInfo ↔ Toggle debugToggle.isOn
// Player clicks toggle → Variable changes → System responds
// Code activates debug → Toggle visual updates
```

**When to use:** For **settings**, **user controls**, and any situation where the user can modify values that should be reflected in the system and vice-versa.

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
  <img src="/img/twoway-binding.png" alt="TwoWay Binding Example" style={{width: '500px'}} />
</div>

---

### 3. **OneTime** (Once Only) - For Setup
**What it does:** Sets the initial property value based on the variable, but doesn't monitor changes afterwards.

**Direction:** SOAP Variable → Unity Property (initialization only)

**Use cases:**
```csharp
// Initial Configuration - Player spawn position
Vector3Variable spawnPosition → Transform.position
// Sets initial position, but player can move freely afterwards

// Visual Setup - Initial material based on level
MaterialVariable levelMaterial → Renderer.material
// Sets material at start, subsequent changes are independent

// System Configuration - Settings that don't change during gameplay
IntVariable maxEnemies → EnemySpawner.maxEnemies
// Sets limit at start, doesn't change during gameplay
```

**When to use:** For **initial configurations** that don't need to change during gameplay, such as spawn positions, system configurations, or base values.

---

### 4. **EventTrigger** (Event Trigger) - For Actions
**What it does:** Connects SOAP Events to Unity methods. When the event is triggered, the method is executed.

**Direction:** SOAP Event → Unity Method

**Use cases:**
```csharp
// Audio System - Play sound when event happens
GameEvent onPlayerDied → AudioSource.Play()
// Player dies → Death sound plays automatically

// Particle System - Visual effect on events
Vector3GameEvent onSpellCast → ParticleSystem.Play()
// Spell is cast → Particle effect at position

// Animation System - Animation trigger
StringGameEvent onActionTrigger → Animator.SetTrigger("ActionName")
// Specific action → Corresponding animation

// Save System - Auto-save at checkpoints
GameEvent onCheckpointReached → SaveSystem.SaveGame()
// Checkpoint reached → Game saves automatically
```

**When to use:** For **immediate reactions** to game events, such as sound effects, visuals, animations, or any action that should happen in response to a specific event.

---

### 5. **Conditional** (Conditional) - For Special Cases
**What it does:** Applies binding only when a condition is met. Monitors a BoolVariable as condition.

**Direction:** SOAP Variable → Unity Property (when condition = true)

**Use cases:**
```csharp
// Ability System - UI only appears when ability is active
Condition: BoolVariable shieldActive = true
Binding: FloatVariable shieldPower → Slider shieldBar.value
// Shield active → Bar appears and shows power
// Shield inactive → Bar disappears

// Admin System - Controls only for administrators
Condition: BoolVariable isAdmin = true  
Binding: StringVariable debugMessage → Text debugLabel.text
// Is admin → Debug messages appear
// Not admin → Nothing happens

// Combat System - Crosshair only appears in combat
Condition: BoolVariable inCombat = true
Binding: Vector3Variable enemyPosition → Crosshair.worldPosition
// In combat → Crosshair follows enemy
// Out of combat → Crosshair doesn't move
```

**When to use:** For bindings that should only work under **specific conditions**, such as debug modes, special game states, or features that depend on permissions.

---

### 6. **Transformed** (With Transformation) - For Advanced Effects
**What it does:** Applies mathematical transformations to values before sending them to the property.

**Direction:** SOAP Variable → [Transformation] → Unity Property

**Use cases:**
```csharp
// Health System - Percentage health with dramatic curve
Input: IntVariable health (0-100)
Transformation: Exponential curve to dramatize low health
Output: Image.fillAmount (0-1)
// 50% health → Appears as 25% on bar (more dramatic)

// Audio System - Volume with distance falloff
Input: FloatVariable distance (0-50)
Transformation: Inverse exponential curve
Output: AudioSource.volume (1-0)
// Distance 10m → Volume 0.3, Distance 25m → Volume 0.05

// UI System - Color based on temperature
Input: FloatVariable temperature (-10 to 40)
Transformation: Range mapping + Gradient
Output: Image.color (blue to red)
// -5°C → Light blue, 35°C → Intense red
```

**When to use:** When you need to **convert** or **enhance** value presentation, such as dramatic health bars, realistic speedometers, or any visualization that needs mathematical adjustment.

## Choosing the Right Mode

| **Situation** | **Recommended Mode** | **Why** |
|---------------|---------------------|---------|
| Health bar, Score display, Status UI | **OneWay** | Only needs to show info |
| Settings sliders, Input fields | **TwoWay** | User needs to modify |
| Spawn position, Initial configs | **OneTime** | Only configures at start |
| Sound effects, Animations | **EventTrigger** | Response to events |
| Debug panels, Admin features | **Conditional** | Only when allowed |
| Speedometer, Dramatic health bars | **Transformed** | Needs conversion |

4. OnHitEnemy → HitEffect.Play() (EventTrigger)
5. OnEnemyDied → DeathSound.Play() (EventTrigger)
```

**Behavior:**
```csharp
Combat Flow:
- InCombat = false → Enemy health bar hidden
- InCombat = true → Enemy health bar appears
- OnHitEnemy raised → Particle effect plays
- OnEnemyDied raised → Death sound plays
```

## Advanced Features

### Value Transformation

Transform values using animation curves and range mapping:

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
  <img src="/img/binding-transformation.png" alt="Value Transformation" style={{width: '400px'}} />
</div>

**Transformation Pipeline:**
1. **Input Range** - Map input values to 0-1 range
2. **Animation Curve** - Apply curve transformation
3. **Output Range** - Map to final output range

**Example: Health Bar with Curve**
```csharp
Input: IntVariable playerHealth (0-100)
Curve: Ease-in curve for dramatic low-health warning
Output: Image.fillAmount (0-1) with red tint at low values
```

### Performance Optimization

**Automatic Optimization:**
- **Update Throttling** - Slow bindings automatically capped to 60 FPS
- **Change Detection** - Only update when values actually change
- **Batch Processing** - Multiple bindings updated efficiently
- **Performance Monitoring** - Real-time performance tracking

**Manual Control:**
```csharp
// Per-binding settings
updateInterval = 0.016f;  // 60 FPS maximum
autoUpdate = true;        // Automatic updates
validateOnBind = true;    // Runtime validation
maxUpdatesPerFrame = 10;  // Throttling
