## Understanding the Basics

### What are Bindings?

Bindings are **connections** between SOAP assets (Variables/Events) and Unity components that automatically synchronize data:

```csharp
// Instead of writing this code:
void Update() {
    healthSlider.value = playerHealth.Value;
    nameText.text = playerName.Value;
    // ... dozens of similar lines
}

// You create visual bindings:
PlayerHealth → HealthSlider.value (automatic)
PlayerName → NameText.text (automatic) 
```

### The SOAPBind Component

The **SOAPBind** component is the heart of the system. Add it to GameObjects to manage their bindings:

```csharp
SOAPBind Features:
├── 📋 Multiple Bindings - Manage many connections in one component
├── ⚡ Auto-Updates - Handles all synchronization automatically  
├── 🎯 Smart Detection - Finds components and properties for you
├── 📊 Performance Monitoring - Tracks performance in real-time
├── 🔧 Hot Reload - Edit bindings during Play Mode
└── 🐞 Visual Debugging - See connections in Scene view
```

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
  <img src="/img/soap-bind-component.png" alt="SOAP Bind Component Inspector" style={{width: '400px'}} />
</div>

### Understanding the Inspector

When you select a GameObject with SOAPBind, the Inspector shows:

```csharp
SOAPBind Component Inspector:

🔗 Binding List (initially empty)
   ├── [No bindings created yet]
   
🔧 Controls
   ├── ➕ Add Binding        // Create new binding
   ├── 📊 Performance Info   // Show performance stats  
   ├── 🐞 Debug Mode         // Enable debugging
   └── ⚙️ Auto Optimize      // Enable performance optimization
```

---

## How to Organize Your Bindings

You can organize your bindings in different ways depending on your project needs:

### Strategy 1: Centralized Hub (Recommended for Beginners)
```csharp
GameObject: "UI_BindingHub"
└── SOAPBind (manages ALL UI bindings)

Advantages:
✅ All bindings in one place
✅ Easy to find and manage
✅ Great for learning
✅ Simple performance monitoring
```

### Strategy 2: Component-Level
```csharp
GameObject: "HealthBar" 
├── Slider
└── SOAPBind (manages only health bar bindings)

GameObject: "ScoreText"
├── Text  
└── SOAPBind (manages only score text bindings)

Advantages:
✅ Bindings stay with components
✅ Better for prefabs
✅ Modular organization
```

### Strategy 3: System-Specific Hubs
```csharp
GameObject: "Audio_BindingHub"
└── Manages all audio-related bindings

GameObject: "Animation_BindingHub"  
└── Manages all animation-related bindings

GameObject: "UI_BindingHub"
└── Manages all UI-related bindings

Advantages:
✅ Organized by system responsibility
✅ Clear separation of concerns
✅ Ideal for large projects
```

## Binding Modes Explained

Now that you understand the basics, let's explore the different types of connections you can create:

### 1. **OneWay** (Unidirectional) - Most Common
**What it does:** Connects a SOAP Variable to a Unity property. When the variable changes, the property is automatically updated.

**Direction:** SOAP Variable → Unity Property

**Use cases:**
```csharp
// Health System - Health bar that shows player life
IntVariable playerHealth → Slider healthBar.value
// Player loses health → Slider updates automatically

// UI System - Player name in interface
StringVariable playerName → Text nameLabel.text
// Name changes in code → UI updates instantly

// Audio System - Dynamic volume based on distance
FloatVariable distanceVolume → AudioSource.volume
// Player moves away → Sound gets quieter automatically

// Visual System - UI color based on team
ColorVariable teamColor → Image backgroundImage.color
// Player changes team → Interface changes color
```

**When to use:** When you want to **display** game information in UI or other components, but don't need the user to directly modify the values.

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
  <img src="/img/oneway-binding.png" alt="OneWay Binding Example" style={{width: '500px'}} />
</div>

---

### 2. **TwoWay** (Bidirectional) - For User Input
**What it does:** Synchronization in both directions. The variable and property stay synchronized at all times.

**Direction:** SOAP Variable ↔ Unity Property

**Use cases:**
```csharp
// Game Settings - Volume slider
FloatVariable masterVolume ↔ Slider volumeSlider.value
// Player moves slider → Variable updates → Audio changes
// Code changes volume → Slider moves automatically

// Input System - Player name input field
StringVariable playerName ↔ InputField nameInput.text
// Player types → Variable updates
// System changes name → Input field updates

// Debug Settings - Debug toggle
BoolVariable showDebugInfo ↔ Toggle debugToggle.isOn
// Player clicks toggle → Variable changes → System responds
// Code activates debug → Toggle visual updates
```

**When to use:** For **settings**, **user controls**, and any situation where the user can modify values that should be reflected in the system and vice-versa.

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
  <img src="/img/twoway-binding.png" alt="TwoWay Binding Example" style={{width: '500px'}} />
</div>

---

### 3. **OneTime** (Once Only) - For Setup
**What it does:** Sets the initial property value based on the variable, but doesn't monitor changes afterwards.

**Direction:** SOAP Variable → Unity Property (initialization only)

**Use cases:**
```csharp
// Initial Configuration - Player spawn position
Vector3Variable spawnPosition → Transform.position
// Sets initial position, but player can move freely afterwards

// Visual Setup - Initial material based on level
MaterialVariable levelMaterial → Renderer.material
// Sets material at start, subsequent changes are independent

// System Configuration - Settings that don't change during gameplay
IntVariable maxEnemies → EnemySpawner.maxEnemies
// Sets limit at start, doesn't change during gameplay
```

**When to use:** For **initial configurations** that don't need to change during gameplay, such as spawn positions, system configurations, or base values.

---

### 4. **EventTrigger** (Event Trigger) - For Actions
**What it does:** Connects SOAP Events to Unity methods. When the event is triggered, the method is executed.

**Direction:** SOAP Event → Unity Method

**Use cases:**
```csharp
// Audio System - Play sound when event happens
GameEvent onPlayerDied → AudioSource.Play()
// Player dies → Death sound plays automatically

// Particle System - Visual effect on events
Vector3GameEvent onSpellCast → ParticleSystem.Play()
// Spell is cast → Particle effect at position

// Animation System - Animation trigger
StringGameEvent onActionTrigger → Animator.SetTrigger("ActionName")
// Specific action → Corresponding animation

// Save System - Auto-save at checkpoints
GameEvent onCheckpointReached → SaveSystem.SaveGame()
// Checkpoint reached → Game saves automatically
```

**When to use:** For **immediate reactions** to game events, such as sound effects, visuals, animations, or any action that should happen in response to a specific event.

---

### 5. **Conditional** (Conditional) - For Special Cases
**What it does:** Applies binding only when a condition is met. Monitors a BoolVariable as condition.

**Direction:** SOAP Variable → Unity Property (when condition = true)

**Use cases:**
```csharp
// Ability System - UI only appears when ability is active
Condition: BoolVariable shieldActive = true
Binding: FloatVariable shieldPower → Slider shieldBar.value
// Shield active → Bar appears and shows power
// Shield inactive → Bar disappears

// Admin System - Controls only for administrators
Condition: BoolVariable isAdmin = true  
Binding: StringVariable debugMessage → Text debugLabel.text
// Is admin → Debug messages appear
// Not admin → Nothing happens

// Combat System - Crosshair only appears in combat
Condition: BoolVariable inCombat = true
Binding: Vector3Variable enemyPosition → Crosshair.worldPosition
// In combat → Crosshair follows enemy
// Out of combat → Crosshair doesn't move
```

**When to use:** For bindings that should only work under **specific conditions**, such as debug modes, special game states, or features that depend on permissions.

---

### 6. **GameObject Direct Control** - For GameObject Operations
**What it does:** Provides direct control over GameObject properties like visibility, name, tag, and layer without needing to target specific components.

**Direction:** SOAP Variable → GameObject Property

**Supported Operations:**
```csharp
// Visibility Control - Show/Hide GameObjects
BoolVariable playerAlive → GameObject.Active (UI death panel)
// Player dies → Death panel appears automatically
// Player respawns → Death panel disappears automatically

// Dynamic Naming - Change GameObject names at runtime
StringVariable playerName → GameObject.Name (player GameObject)
// Player changes name → GameObject name updates in hierarchy
// Great for debugging and organization

// Tag Management - Dynamic tag assignment
StringVariable currentTeam → GameObject.Tag (player GameObject)
// Player switches teams → GameObject tag updates
// Collision detection and gameplay logic responds automatically

// Layer Control - Dynamic layer switching
IntVariable renderLayer → GameObject.Layer (UI GameObject)
// UI mode changes → GameObject moves to appropriate layer
// Rendering order and camera culling respond automatically
```

**When to use:** For **GameObject-level operations** where you need to control the GameObject itself rather than specific components. Perfect for UI panels, debugging aids, and dynamic object organization.

---

### 7. **Transformed** (With Transformation) - For Advanced Effects
**What it does:** Applies mathematical transformations to values before sending them to the property.

**Direction:** SOAP Variable → [Transformation] → Unity Property

**Use cases:**
```csharp
// Health System - Percentage health with dramatic curve
Input: IntVariable health (0-100)
Transformation: Exponential curve to dramatize low health
Output: Image.fillAmount (0-1)
// 50% health → Appears as 25% on bar (more dramatic)

// Audio System - Volume with distance falloff
Input: FloatVariable distance (0-50)
Transformation: Inverse exponential curve
Output: AudioSource.volume (1-0)
// Distance 10m → Volume 0.3, Distance 25m → Volume 0.05

// UI System - Color based on temperature
Input: FloatVariable temperature (-10 to 40)
Transformation: Range mapping + Gradient
Output: Image.color (blue to red)
// -5°C → Light blue, 35°C → Intense red
```

**When to use:** When you need to **convert** or **enhance** value presentation, such as dramatic health bars, realistic speedometers, or any visualization that needs mathematical adjustment.

## Choosing the Right Mode

| **Situation** | **Recommended Mode** | **Why** |
|---------------|---------------------|---------|
| Health bar, Score display, Status UI | **OneWay** | Only needs to show info |
| Settings sliders, Input fields | **TwoWay** | User needs to modify |
| Spawn position, Initial configs | **OneTime** | Only configures at start |
| Sound effects, Animations | **EventTrigger** | Response to events |
| Debug panels, Admin features | **Conditional** | Only when allowed |
| GameObject show/hide, UI panels | **GameObject Control** | Direct object manipulation |
| Speedometer, Dramatic health bars | **Transformed** | Needs conversion |

## Advanced Features

### Value Transformation System (NEW!)

The SOAPBind system now includes **professional-grade value transformations** that allow you to modify values before they reach their target components. This powerful feature eliminates the need for intermediate scripts and provides sophisticated data manipulation directly in the editor.

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
  <img src="/img/binding-transformation.png" alt="Value Transformation" style={{width: '400px'}} />
</div>

#### Available Transformation Types

**1. Boolean Transformations**
Perfect for inverting logic or negating boolean values:

```csharp
// Invert Boolean (NOT operation)
Input: BoolVariable isPlayerAlive = true
Transform: Invert = true  
Output: GameObject.Active (death screen) = false
// Result: Death screen hidden when player is alive

// Use Cases:
- Show death screen when player is NOT alive
- Enable UI when feature is NOT active
- Hide elements when condition is NOT met
```

**2. Numeric Transformations (Animation Curves)**
Transform numeric values using **Animation Curves** with custom input/output ranges:

```csharp
// Health Bar with Dramatic Curve
Input: FloatVariable playerHealth (0-100)
Input Range: 0, 100
Animation Curve: Ease-in curve (slow start, fast end)
Output Range: 0, 1
Target: Image.fillAmount

// Result: Health bar shows dramatic changes at low health
// 100% health → 100% bar (normal)
// 50% health → 30% bar (dramatic warning)  
// 10% health → 5% bar (critical warning)
```

**Advanced Curve Applications:**
- **Ease-Out**: Smooth deceleration for natural UI animations
- **Exponential**: Dramatic changes at specific ranges
- **S-Curve**: Gentle start and end, fast middle
- **Custom**: Any mathematical function via curve points

**3. String Formatting**
Professional string formatting with **full C# format string support**:

```csharp
// Basic Formatting
Input: IntVariable playerScore = 1250
Format: "Score: {0}"
Output: "Score: 1250"

// Advanced Formatting Examples:
"Health: {0:F1}%"      → "Health: 78.5%"      // 1 decimal place  
"CPS: {0:F2}"          → "CPS: 15.67"         // 2 decimal places
"Level {0:D2}"         → "Level 05"           // 2-digit with leading zeros
"Progress: {0:P0}"     → "Progress: 85%"      // Percentage format
"Currency: {0:C}"      → "Currency: $12.50"   // Currency (locale-aware)
```

#### Supported Variable Types & Transformations

| **Variable Type** | **Boolean Invert** | **Numeric Transform** | **String Format** | **Common Use Cases** |
|-------------------|--------------------|-----------------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| **BoolVariable** | ✅ YES | ❌ No | ✅ YES | UI toggles, inverted logic, enable/disable |
| **FloatVariable** | ❌ No | ✅ YES | ✅ YES | Health bars, progress, smooth animations |
| **IntVariable** | ❌ No | ✅ YES | ✅ YES | Scores, counters, discrete values |
| **StringVariable** | ❌ No | ❌ No | ✅ YES | Text display, names, descriptions |
| **Vector2Variable** | ❌ No | ✅ YES* | ✅ YES | UI positioning, 2D coordinates |
| **Vector3Variable** | ❌ No | ✅ YES* | ✅ YES | 3D positions, rotations, scaling |
| **ColorVariable** | ❌ No | ✅ YES* | ❌ No | Color transitions, UI theming |

*Vector and Color transformations apply to each component separately (X,Y,Z or R,G,B)

#### Transformation Pipeline

**Step-by-Step Process:**
1. **Source Value** - Get value from SOAP Variable
2. **Boolean Transform** - Apply inversion if enabled (BoolVariable only)
3. **Numeric Transform** - Apply animation curve if enabled
   - Map input value to Input Range (0-1)  
   - Evaluate Animation Curve at normalized position
   - Map curve result to Output Range
4. **String Formatting** - Apply format string if enabled
5. **Target Assignment** - Send final value to Unity component

#### Real-World Transformation Examples

**Example 1: Dramatic Health Bar**
```csharp
Purpose: Make health bar more visually dramatic at low health
Input: FloatVariable health (0-100)
Transform: Custom curve - flat until 50%, then steep drop
Result: Player notices low health immediately

Configuration:
- Input Range: 0, 100
- Animation Curve: Points (0,0) (0.5,0.8) (1.0,1.0) 
- Output Range: 0, 1
- Target: Image.fillAmount
```

**Example 2: Speedometer with Realistic Physics**
```csharp
Purpose: Car speedometer with realistic acceleration curve
Input: FloatVariable velocity (0-200 km/h)
Transform: S-curve for realistic acceleration feel
Result: Speedometer moves like real car dashboard

Configuration:
- Input Range: 0, 200
- Animation Curve: S-curve (slow-fast-slow)
- Output Range: 0, 240 (speedometer goes to 240)
- Target: Transform.rotation (needle angle)
```

**Example 3: Context-Aware Score Display**
```csharp
Purpose: Show score with appropriate formatting based on magnitude
Input: IntVariable score = 1250000
Transform: String formatting with thousands separators
Result: Clean, readable score display

Configuration:
- String Format: "Score: {0:N0}"
- Output: "Score: 1,250,000"
- Target: TextMeshPro.text
```

**Example 4: Inverted UI Logic**
```csharp
Purpose: Show "Game Over" screen when player is NOT alive
Input: BoolVariable isPlayerAlive = true
Transform: Invert Boolean = true
Result: Game Over screen hidden when alive, shown when dead

Configuration:
- Boolean Invert: true
- Target: GameObject.Active (GameOverPanel)
- Final Logic: Show panel when isPlayerAlive = false
```

### Performance Optimization

**🚀 Event-Driven Architecture (NEW!):**
- **Pure Event-Driven Updates** - Zero Update() polling when possible
- **Instant Response** - Zero latency between data change and UI update  
- **CPU Efficient** - Updates only when data actually changes
- **Battery Friendly** - Reduced CPU usage on mobile devices
- **Scalable Performance** - Performance doesn't degrade with binding count

**Performance Thresholds for Event-Driven System:**
- **🟢 Optimal (< 0.5ms)** - Perfect event-driven performance
- **🟡 Good (< 2ms)** - Acceptable performance, minor optimization recommended  
- **🔴 Needs Optimization (≥ 2ms)** - Consider simpler transformations or alternatives

**Automatic Optimization:**
- **Smart Event Detection** - Automatically uses events when available
- **Polling Fallback** - Graceful fallback for non-event assets
- **Update Throttling** - Prevents expensive operations from overwhelming system
- **Change Detection** - Only update when values actually change
- **Performance Monitoring** - Real-time tracking with color-coded feedback

**Manual Control:**
```csharp
// Per-binding settings
updateInterval = 0.0f;    // Event-driven (recommended)
updateInterval = 0.016f;  // 60 FPS maximum polling
autoUpdate = true;        // Automatic updates  
validateOnBind = true;    // Runtime validation
maxUpdatesPerFrame = 16;  // Event-driven throttling
```

**Performance Benefits Comparison:**
```
Event-Driven Bindings:     ~0.1ms per update (when events fire)
Traditional Polling:       ~0.5ms per frame (continuous)
CPU Usage Reduction:       80-95% improvement
Battery Life Impact:       Significantly improved on mobile
```
